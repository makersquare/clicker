// This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.js, which will include all the files
// listed below. This manifest file is specifically for the angular portion of the application which begins 
// at class_groups/show.html.erb
//
// Any JavaScript/Coffee file within this directory, lib/assets/javascripts, vendor/assets/javascripts,
// or vendor/assets/javascripts of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path.
//
// It's not advisable to add code directly here, but if you do, it'll appear at the bottom of the
// compiled file.
